summary: Master Node for Hadoop
description: |
  The Hadoop Distributed Filesystem (HDFS) requires one unique server, the
  namenode, which manages the block locations of files on the
  filesystem.  The jobtracker is a central service which is responsible
  for managing the tasktracker services running on all nodes in a
  Hadoop Cluster.  The jobtracker allocates work to the tasktracker
  nearest to the data with an available work slot.
